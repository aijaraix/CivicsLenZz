# CODEX START HERE — CivicLenZ

Before making architectural, runtime, worker, research, UI, Cloudflare, Supabase, VPS, OpenClaw, or HERMES changes, read the authoritative control-plane documentation in `docs/control-plane/`.

The master implementation directive defines the seven-stage production activation sequence. Follow it in order while continuing autonomously through non-destructive implementation. Do not reinterpret a stage exit gate as permission to bypass evidence, safety, credential, schema, or production-change controls.

The producer/frontier documents define the replaceable-producer model, canonical machine-readable research specifications, non-duplication/work reservations, and the invariant that Seat discovery must trigger election and candidate research in parallel. Implement integrations so Gemini/CivicsLenZz can accelerate the frontier without becoming required for continuity or bypassing HERMES validation.

Then inspect the existing implementation and current production state before proposing or making changes.

## Non-negotiable doctrines
- Seat-centric architecture.
- Seat discovery requires election/candidate discovery in parallel; candidates are first-class.
- Producers are replaceable executors; HERMES owns research intent, work identity, reservations, priority, validation and recovery.
- No global `COMPLETE` state for a Person/Candidate/Seat/profile; only bounded currentness/reconciliation with cutoff + monitoring.
- `CAPABILITY_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` is operational state, never a factual `checked_no_authoritative_result` claim.
- Evidence-first and publication-eligible-claims-only public projection.
- Research workers do not self-verify material civic claims.
- Deterministic-first collection/processing.
- Search/browser discovery may find evidence but search snippets are not evidence.
- HERMES Prime is the persistent executive/orchestrator.
- OpenClaw is the conversational/research-request/action gateway and tool layer.
- Qwen local is a bounded reasoning utility, not civic truth authority.
- Cloudflare remains the distributed deterministic execution fabric.
- Supabase is structured civic state; R2 is raw evidence; GitHub is implementation/docs/config, not runtime civic storage.
- Maximum safe utilization: use paid compute efficiently while preserving headroom, rate limits and stability.
- Event-first orchestration, heartbeat backstop.
- Monitoring never ends.
- Evolution is core HERMES behavior: every role executes, measures, learns and improves within authorized scope.
- HERMES may evolve research methods but may not silently evolve verification/publication truth standards.
- No synthetic scale, fake records, fake worker activity or simulated production counts.

## Before implementation
For every requested change:
1. inspect existing code and current deployed/live state;
2. identify what already exists and preserve useful working behavior;
3. state the mismatch between implementation and authoritative docs;
4. prefer additive/reversible changes;
5. test locally/CI;
6. use PRs/review for governed changes;
7. never bypass broken pipelines by hand-inserting facts merely to make a demo pass;
8. report physical rows, real worker runs and real deployment identifiers only.

## Cloudflare rule
Cloudflare production configuration should be reproducible from GitHub plus secret stores. Use scoped Cloudflare API tokens/Wrangler permissions for CivicLenZ resources rather than a Global API Key. Dashboard-only drift should be reconciled back into repository configuration.

## Production-runtime rule
Codex/GrokBot/ChatGPT are builders, maintainers and copilots. CivicLenZ must continue operating when they are offline. HERMES/OpenClaw/Cloudflare/Supabase/R2 constitute the persistent runtime.
